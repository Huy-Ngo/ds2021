\section{Protocol}

We modify the provided simple chat system to make this file transfering system.
In this proof-of-concept we only concerns the file sending from the client to the server.

After the initial request for connection being accepted, the client sends to the server
the file's metadata:

\begin{itemize}
	\item file size, so that the server knows how many packets to receive
	\item file name, so that the server knows what to save as
\end{itemize}

The client consequently sends chunks of data until all the file is sent.
After that, it prompts to disconnect with the server.

\section{System organization}

In this system, the client and the server each has a program dedicated for sending or receiving
and a file system. The sender program reads the file at the client and send it to the server
using TCP/IP protocol. The receiver program at the server writes to a file upon receiving the data.
